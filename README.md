## Booking system
Movie Tickets

## Description
We will be building a movie ticket booking system. Where users can choose a specific movie, show time and location of the theater. The user will be asked to enter the number of tickets they would like to purchase. They will not be asked again if they wish to go back and choose a different time show. Next the user will get a selection of seat choices to choose from. Lastly, there will be a payment form where the user will be asked to submit their cardholder name, card number, pin-code, and zip code of the card. After completion, the user will be returned their name with the show time, location and seat number.
